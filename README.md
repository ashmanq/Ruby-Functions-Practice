# Ruby Functions Practice

An app produced as an excerise to learn how to:
* create function
* create objects
* assign variables
* call functions
* practice writing tests

The app consists of a main ruby functions script containing a list of functions; and a test script in the specs
folder that tests that the functions are working as expected. This is a demonstration of unit testing.

# Run Test
To run the test use the following command in terminal:
```Ruby
ruby specs/ruby_functions_spec.rb
```
